# LEGOlass : Convert images to lego mosaic patterns. 

The number of colors are reduced and only Solid Lego colors are used to represent the final image
The mosaic pattern are generated based on a grid based system for the input image while averaging colors within a particular cell in the grid.

Try it out using the simple commands :-

# python legolass.py &lt;input image&gt; &lt;grid size&gt;

Example :-
python legolass.py legolas.jpg 8
